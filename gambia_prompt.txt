I’m building a Streamlit app called "Gambia Price Tracker" to help track the prices of common goods (like bread, rice, sugar, etc.) across different locations in The Gambia over time.

Here is what the app currently does:
- Allows users to input: item name, price, location, and date.
- Saves this data in a local CSV file called `prices.csv`.
- Displays a full price history table.
- Shows a line chart of price trends over time using Plotly.

I want to improve this app and make it more useful, beautiful, and professional.

Here is what I need help with:

1. Suggest and implement useful **features** that would add value to the app (filtering, averages, comparisons, alerts, etc.).
2. Improve the **code quality** — structure it better, make it more modular, add comments, and fix any bugs or bad practices.
3. Make the app look better and work better on **mobile**.
4. Keep it **easy to deploy** (I’m using Streamlit Cloud or local server).
5. Suggest how I can use this project in my **portfolio** or **resume**.
6. Bonus: How can I later add **user login**, connect it to **a database** (instead of CSV), or deploy to a real domain?

Here is my current code (paste the full Python code after this message).

Please analyze it like a senior developer doing a code review for a junior dev. Give suggestions clearly, and help improve it step by step. Be direct and constructive.

I’m from The Gambia, and this app is for local use.

Thanks!
